## Deploying

You'll have to set the following environment variables to setup the backend and frontend, here is a list of them:

- [Backend Environment Variables](api/.env.example)
- [Frontend Environment Variables](web/.env.example)

> ðŸš¨ Remember to also edit the database id in the [wrangler.toml](api/wrangler.toml)

### Cloudflare Workers

You can deploy both, frontend and backend, to Cloudflare Workers by running the following commands:

```bash
pnpm install

# Deploy the backend
cd api
pnpm run deploy
```

The frontend can be deployed on cloudflare pages from their web dashboard.

### Selfhosting

If you want to selfhost, you can run `pnpm install`, `pnpm build` and `pnpm dev` to start the program.

The dashboard will usually be available [here](http://localhost:3000/).
